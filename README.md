# _Itransition Course Project_ 

***_Collection Management_*** 

Name of this projectis is known as 'Collection Management'. Backend side of project has writen in Spring boot. It involves some necessery controllers, services, repositories and work process of Websocket. For database I have choosen Postgresql. Backend connected with database using Spring Data JPA. Into database you can see some useful functions, triggers and process of Full Text Search. Also project has front side which has writen in ReactJs. I used Redux for connecting with global store, reactJs Tolkit for building this global store, React Quill for building markdown pattern and Material UI for making website style more beautiful. So after completing both side of project I put it into EC2 server which belongs to aws.amazon.com. Below you can find link to project and credentials for sign in as admin.
